# Express RTC
 Video chat application


### Description

creating a room will generate new uuid and set it as a link.
the second client to join the link will be connected to the peer and automatically start a video call if video source is available.
thrid client would be redirect to index page.
There is no enforcement on uuid link, therefor upon joining room with anything but the word "new" will generate a proper room with the chosen ID, if you want a private room click "new room" or go to /new route and you will be redirected.
upon joining a room, either as creator or a second client, window alert will pop and ask for username.
